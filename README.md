## Getting started

### Project structure

Inside LAN.DA template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ styles/
|   |       â””â”€â”€ base.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ general/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Welcome.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ BaseLayout.astro
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ PageLayout.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ 404.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

<br>

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages

  title: "Example title",
  description: "Example description",
};


```

<br>

### Deploy

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.
